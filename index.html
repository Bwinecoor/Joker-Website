          <h5>Batman: The Killing Joke</h5>
          <div class="first">
            <p class="green">This version of the Joker was a struggling comedian with a pregnant wife. He was
              behind on
              rent and had to make money somehow so he had to turn to crime. He was hired by a crew to break into Ace
              Chemicals and steal something. After being hired the news was broken to him that both his wife and the
              baby
              died in an accident. He didn't want to take the job anymore because of this but he didn't have a choice
              and
              was forced to wear a disguise. His disguise was the Red Hood, basically a black suit, red cape, and a
              red
              glass helmet. As soon they got there a guard spotted them and opened fire, Batman found out and arrived
              there shortly to resolve the issue without anymore casualties but when Joker saw him, he was frightened
              and
              tripped over the edge and fell into a vat of acid. His skin became while, lips became red, hair was
              green,
              and had a huge smile on his face.</p>

            tells people
            how he became the way he is, how he got those scars, he has said that either he had an abuse father or he
            did it to himself because his wife had a face scar and he tried to make her feel better. He is also hands
            down the best Joker from any live action film.</p>

            It was later revealed that he actually was a sociopathic and eventually began to become evil because of
            the abuse he faced from the people of Gotham City. At one point while being assulted This lead him to
            become the vengeful anarchist known as Joker.</p>

          <p class="green">Jerome and Jeramiah Valeska are not actually the Joker, but two different versions of him.
            The show Gotham did not have the rights for the use of the Joker so they had to make their own adaptations
            of him which turned out to be perfect. Jerome was a circus boy whos father left him and he had an
            alcoholic/abusive mother. All of her abusiveness drove him mad to the point where he ended up killing her,
            which starting an investigation in GCPD and led to him meeting Detective James Gordon, who eventually
            found out he killed his mother and revealed who his father is.</p>

          <p class="green"> Jeramiah left Jerome at a young age to have a better education somewhere else and because
            he felt that he was in danger being near Jerome, as he would often abuse and scare him as a child. When
            Jerome finds out where his brother went he eventually got to him and after a quick talk toexplain that he
            wanted to kill him he had to let him go because Jim and Harvey showed up. The way that Jeramiah becomes
            the Joker is after Jerome dies he had a package sent to Jeramiah, which said that it was from Bruce Wayne
            who he recently became close to, but when he opened it he was sprayed with a special mixture that Jerome
            had made, just for him, making him insane and turning him into the Joker.</p>

      <h1>Origin:</h1>
      <p>The Joker, otherwise known as Jack Oswald White is a fictional character from DC Comics and is known for
        being a psychopathic murderer who does not care for anyone he has killed and being the arch nemesis of
        Batman.
        The creation of the Joker was inspired by the look of performer Conrad Veidt in a 1928 film adaptation of
        The
        Man Who Laughs. In the fictional world/DC Comics, most adaptations of the Joker's origin include him being a
        struggling comedian with a pregnant wife. He turns to a little bit of crime to get more money to support his
        family but during a break in at Ace Chemicals where he was disguised as Red Hood, but Batman showed up
        thinking he was actually the Red Hood and scared him to the point where Jack fell of the ledge and fell into
        a
        vat of acid, turning his skin white, hair green, and made him go insane.</p>

        of
        a building in Tim Burton's Batman, in the Injustice Universe, Superman punches Joker right through his
        heart,

        <h1 class="text-center">Famous Accomplishments:</h1>
        <p>Some of the biggest things that the Joker has ever done was when he tricked Batmite (a batman stan from
          the
          5th dimension with god like powers) into giving him his powers,, which he then used to eat china,
          repetitively kill Batman then bring him back over and over just to do it again. Another thing he did was
          paralyse Barbara Gordon/Batgirl. Lastly, the most famous thing he did was kill Jason Todd, causing him to
          eventually be reborn and become the Red Hood.
